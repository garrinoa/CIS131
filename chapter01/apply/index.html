		<p>Planning a website must occur in several stages; first, it is necessary to define the site's purpose and target-audience. Next, a web-developer must plan the structure of the website, including the visual layout (i.e., creating a rough wireframe design), and the relationship between pages of the site (the site map). Once the rough outlines (wireframe and site map) are defined, the designer should consider which visual elements they will utilize, including graphics, font style and size, and color schemes. Finally, accessibility features should be considered and planned (localization, alternative text entries, etc.)</p>
		
		<p>Chapter 1 introduced concepts which are foundational to web development. First, the basic structure of the internet was introduced, including the different protocols which enable node-to-node communication and how the content being communicated can be displayed (i.e., different web browsers). Next, the basic steps of planning a website were introduced (see above). Finally, a step-by-step walkthrough of writing and displaying a basic web page was shown.</p>
